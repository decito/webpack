# vue-dev-env

## Welcome!

I created this repo to study about vue in a real development environment ðŸ˜„

This project is built with Webpack, Babel, SASS and PostCSS

### Webpack
The asset bundler chosen to this project (so far, since I'll probably migrate to vite later).

But why bundle assets?

The best way to maintain an application is to organize and separate code in different files. However, this isn't ideal to production environment, because the fewer files the browser has to download, the better. Pleasure, webpack.

### Babel
The backwards "compatibilator".

A Javascript compiler that enable to use JS sintax that may not be available in some browsers (basically ECMAScript 2015+).

### SASS
CSS with superpowers.

Literally, can you imagine using CSS with variables?! Pleasure, SASS.

###PostCSS
Basically, allows JS to manipulate CSS through an object generated by PostCSS (JS doesn't know what CSS is).
